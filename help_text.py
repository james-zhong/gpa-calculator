overview_desc = "This application will convert all of your NCEA grades into a grade point average (GPA). The GPA is a 12 point scale, where 1 is the lowest (Low Not Achieved) and 12 is the highest (High Excellence). You can input how many grades you have gotten (from your school webportal, etc) into the provided input boxes and the GPA will be calculated automatically. Once there is input, it will also show you how many Excellences and High Excellences you need to raise your GPA to an Excellence and also show you how many High Excellences you need to raise your GPA to a High Excellence (if your GPA is not already at Excellence/High Excellence). If you would like to save your inputs for next time, you can save your inputs and also load it using the Save/Load buttons."

warning_desc = """
Please note that this GPA is not accurate, as grades received from certain subjects may not be applicable for Low/High grades, etc. This application is so that you know where you're at and how you can improve.

If you plan on using the save and load feature, the save file will be named as 'save.vault'. Please do not replace this file with another random file and name it 'save.vault'. When loading data, the program will unpack the data from save.vault. If you modify the data in save.vault, there may potentially be an error when trying to load the data in. If you replace the save.vault file with a random file from the internet and rename it to 'save. vault' (for some reason), you can potentially get a virus because you don't know what is on the file.

ui_desc = """
To input your grades, using tha amount of Excellences as an example, firstly, go to your student webportal (or equivalent) to see an overview of your results and count how many Excellences you have. Next, go to the box underneath the 'Excellence' label and click on the box and enter the amount of Excellences you have. Repeat this with all the grades. If you do not have any results of a particular grade, it will stay at 0.

Press the buttons at the top-left to save/load your inputs. A message will appear to confirm the success/error. Saving will store all inputs and can be loaded anytime, but only one save file can be saved at a time, so saving overrides previous saved data. Multiple save files may be added in the future.
