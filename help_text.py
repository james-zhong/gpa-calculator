This application will convert all of your NCEA grades into a grade point average (GPA). 
The GPA is a 12 point scale, where 1 is the lowest (Low Not Achieved) and 12 is the 
highest (High Excellence). You can input how many grades you have gotten (from your 
school webportal, etc) into the provided input boxes and the GPA will be calculated 
automatically. Once there is input, it will also show you how many Excellences and 
High Excellences you need to raise your GPA to an Excellence and also show you how 
many High Excellences you need to raise your GPA to a High Excellence (if your 
GPA is not already at Excellence/High Excellence). If you would like to save your 
inputs for next time, you can save your inputs and also load it using the Save/Load 
buttons. Please do not attempt to change the properties in the save file or replace 
it, as it may break the program and/or potentially harm your own device.
