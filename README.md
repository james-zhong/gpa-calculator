## For NCEA grades  
Input the results of your assignments/assessments (from Low Not Achieved, Not Achieved, High Not Achieved, Low Achieved, Achieved, High Achieved, Low Merit, Merit, High Merit, Low Excellence, Excellence, and High Excellence) to get your GPA.

Note that this is ***not*** accurate in any way because of other factors such as grades in certain subjects that cannot receive Low/High grades, etc.

For NCEA Pilot *(worst thing to ever exist)*, convert your pilot grades to NCEA grades:  

__**NCEA - Pilot**__  
* Low Not Achieved - Beginning (Low)  
* Not Achieved - Beginning  
* High Not Achieved - Beginning (High)  
* Low Achieved - Developing (Low)  
* Achieved - Developing  
* High Achieved - Developing (High)  
* Low Merit - Consolidating (Low)  
* Merit - Consolidating  
* High Merit - Consolidating (High)  
* Low Excellence - Excelling (Low)  
* Excellence - Excelling  
* High Excellence - Excelling (High)

*Note that if the calculated GPA has decimals, it will round up. For example, if a GPA is 2.75, the GPA would be rounded to 3 (High Not Achieved)*
